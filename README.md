#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of modelling a software while applying engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems.
Software engineering is important in the technology industry as it enables creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life such as communication and commerce.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Some of the key milestones in the evolution of software engineering include; development of programming languages used to develop useful softwares, establishment of software engineering discipline,enabled development of embedded systems such as automotive softwares that have boosted user and performance experience.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The phases of software development life cycle include;
Requirements -this involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design -this involves creating high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation -this involves writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing -this is the process of conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment -this involves releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance -this involves providing ongoing support,updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile methodology is iterative and involves incremental approach focused on flexibility collaboration and responding to change.It is more appropriately used in software that have no clear and known requirements.
Waterfall methodology is a sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall.It is mostly used in softwares that have known ,clear and fixed requirements.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer writes codes and implements software solutions.
A quality assurance engineer designs and executes test plans to ensure software quality.
A project manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Intergrated Development Environments provide comprehensive tools for writing,debugging and testing code. Examples include eclipse and visual studio.
Version Control Systems track changes to source code and coordinate work among team members. Examples include Git and Subversion.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Some common challenges faced by software engineers include tight deadlines, technical debt and requirement changes.This can be solved by proper planning to avoid tight deadlines, proper budgeting to prevent technical debt and communicating effectively with the client to avoid changing requirements.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing involves testing individual components or modules of software.
Intergration testing involves testing interactions between different components.
System testing involves testing the entire system as a whole.
Acceptance testing involves testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering involves crafting statements or questions to get the best responses from AI models.
It is important as it avoids confusing responses provided by AI models by making the Ai understand exactly what is needed.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
An example of a vague prompt is;write a letter.
A more specific,clear and concise prompt of the same is; explain how to write an application letter.
An improved promt is more effective since it helps the Ai understand the request better.So instead of the AI providing general answers about letters it will now provide an answer about writing an application letter.
